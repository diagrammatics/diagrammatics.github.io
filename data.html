So... what to learn? How to go about it? It seems that the spot to start is at the beginning.</p><p>
Here is a (hand-picked) list of entry-level specializations in Data Analysis on Coursera:</p><p>
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst" target="_blank">
<b>IBM - Data Analyst Professional Certificate</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
4 months at 10 hours/week<br>
Python heavy, Excel, Cognos, SQL<br></p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" target="_blank">
<b>Google - Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a></b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
6 months at 10 hours/week<br>
R heavy, Tableau as well<br></p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst-r-excel" target="_blank">
<b>IBM - Data Analytics with Excel and R Professional Certificate</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
identical to the Python Version, except with R<br>
3 months at 10 hours/week(why shorter?)<br>
thinking I can potentially supplement?</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-visualization" target="_blank"><b>UC Davis - Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
this is all Tableau<br>
1 month at 10 hours/week<br></p><p>

That seems like a pretty good base. From there, it seems like the next step would be to supplement with various options if I feel I've not got a good enough picture. I think it also makes sense to direct my attention towards building a portfolio.</p><p>
Here are some ideas for supplements:</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel-mysql" target="_blank"><b>Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business Specialization</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
6 months at 5 hours/week<br>
Excel and SQL, portfolio project?</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence" target="_blank"><b>Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
could complement analytics curriculum nicely<br>
2 months at 10 hours/week<br></p><p>

I've made a few initial choices which is to prioritize Tableau over Power BI (because I'm not sure I want to get into the Azure toolchain, though I'm sure there's some sort of quickstart for those learning), and at this point, I still can't tell whether or not I'm going to prioritize Python over R (though I'm leaning that way), as it seems that both are quite standard tools in analytics.</p><p>

As it stands, that 560 hours for the foundational coursework (assuming the IBM R course has no overlap), and 200 hours for the supplements. So if I want to get all that done in six months... that's about... 30 hours a week? Yikes. Even just the Google (R) and IBM (Python) courses alone are 400 hours combined which is still 16 hours per week. That's alot. That's a non-negligible amount of labor to put into something like this. And I've got to maintain things as I go. Woah.</p><p>

Another aspect of data analysis is platform-specific knowledge, and there's many platforms, but outside of the Excel/Python/R/SQL stack above, there is some glaring holes (as of 2023). Here are a few other specializations that show some promise in terms of platform:</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-power-bi-data-analyst" target="_blank"><b>Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate</b>↗&#xFE0E</a>"<br>
This is the biggest thing missing from the above, Microsoft's visualization suite, alternative to Tableau<br>
5 months at 10 hours/week</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/sas-programming" target="_blank"><b>SAS Programming Professional Certificate</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
SAS is another widely used analytics platform<br>
2 months at 10 hours/week</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/business-analytics" target="_blank"><b>UPenn - Business Analytics Specialization</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
Also seems like an interesting (soft) complement<br>
1 month at 10 hours/week; pretty quick</p><p>

There's another 320 hours on the secondary supplemental work.</p><p>
 
Not that data science is the goal, because I'm under the impression that you need a degree to get into it, but here are some crunchier specializations in data science that may help round out some theoretical understanding and modeling skills(I think):</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science" target="_blank"><b>IBM - Data Science Professional Certificate</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
Seems like a good overview of DS, applied python, potential portfolio project?<br>
5 months at 10 hours/week</p><p>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="_blank"><b>Hopkins - Data Science Specialization</b>↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
the crunchiest listed, R-based, may require stats<br>
7 months at 10 hours/week, oof<br>
Actually, the 57 hour R course alone may be something to look into</p><p>

And another 480 hours on the DS work.

<h2><a href="#first-post">Data Analytics?</a></h2>
<margin><a href="#tag-meta"><tag>data</tag></a><br>
<date>23-09-05 15:08</date></margin>
<p>
Interested in learning about Data Analytics and Data Science as a potential career projectory. So far, I have a list of bookmarks for courses, but that should probably be a little more formal.</p><p>
One potential approach is to go the Coursera route, seems like there's two big "specializations" (groups of courses), offered by IBM and Google.</p><p>
Looks like SQL <a href="https://learnwithlukas.com/roadmap" target="_blank">may be↗&#xFE0E</a> a good next step. Though it looks like that's covered to an extent by those two specializations. I wonder to what extent exactly?</p>
<p>
It's beginning to seem clearer to me that at least on the analytics side of things, it's sort of like Python and SQL are musts, Excel is not so much a tool as way of translating existing data knowledge to more relevant tools, and that some visualization and business intelligence curriculum is going to be pretty important. I wonder if there is something like an awesome-data-analytics?
<margin>
<a href="https://github.com/newTendermint/awesome-bigdata" target="_blank">eh, sorta.↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience" target="_blank">and kinda.↗&#xFE0E</a>(looks good actually)
</margin>
</p> 
<p>
Something else that occurs to me (an itch, so to speak) is how to sort of build in a bit of diversity into this so that all of my eggs aren't in one basket. There's a bunch of (seemingly) interesting related tracks, but I'm not really sure which are feasible from a jobs standpoint. How do I get data on that?</p>
<p>
I've also started this (currently hosted on GitHub pages) site as a way of tracking my process of learning, whatever that may be. Based on the first commits, it may be clear that this site is a copy of a single page template that I've been working on for quite a while. For the time being, this site is very much under construction.
