<p>
Interested in learning about Data Analytics and Data Science as a potential career projectory. So far, I have a list of bookmarks for courses, but that should probably be a little more formal.</p><p>
One potential approach is to go the Coursera route, seems like there's two big "specializations" (groups of courses), offered by IBM and Google.</p><p>
Looks like SQL <a href="https://learnwithlukas.com/roadmap" target="_blank">may be↗&#xFE0E</a> a good next step. Though it looks like that's covered to an extent by those two specializations. I wonder to what extent exactly?</p>
<p>
It's beginning to seem clearer to me that at least on the analytics side of things, it's sort of like Python and SQL are musts, Excel is not so much a tool as way of translating existing data knowledge to more relevant tools, and that some visualization and business intelligence curriculum is going to be pretty important. I wonder if there is something like an awesome-data-analytics?
<margin>
<a href="https://github.com/newTendermint/awesome-bigdata" target="_blank">eh, sorta.↗&#xFE0E</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience" target="_blank">and kinda.↗&#xFE0E</a>(looks good actually)
</margin>
</p> 
<p>
Something else that occurs to me (an itch, so to speak) is how to sort of build in a bit of diversity into this so that all of my eggs aren't in one basket. There's a bunch of (seemingly) interesting related tracks, but I'm not really sure which are feasible from a jobs standpoint. How do I get data on that?</p>
<p>
I've also started this (currently hosted on GitHub pages) site as a way of tracking my process of learning, whatever that may be. Based on the first commits, it may be clear that this site is a copy of a single page template that I've been working on for quite a while. For the time being, this site is very much under construction.
