<p>
Interested in learning about Data Analytics and Data Science as a potential career projectory. So far, I have a list of bookmarks for courses, but that should probably be a little more formal.</p><p>
One potential approach is to go the Coursera route, seems like there's two big "specializations" (groups of courses), offered by IBM and Google.</p><p>
Looks like SQL <a href="https://learnwithlukas.com/roadmap" target="_blank">may be↗&#xFE0E</a> a good next step. Though it looks like that's covered to an extent by those two specializations. I wonder to what extent exactly?</p>
<p>
Something else that occurs to me (an itch, so to speak) is how to sort of build in a bit of diversity into this so that all of my eggs aren't in one basket. There's a bunch of (seemingly) interesting related tracks, but I'm not really sure which are feasible from a jobs standpoint. How do I get data on that?</p>
